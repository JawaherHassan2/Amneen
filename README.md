The application has 3 types of users:
Users: the security agency, hotels, citizens

Hotels: The application helps to enhance the security of hotels. When a security-requested renter comes or has a report, the hotel will show a security warning aimed at guarding against him and not entering the hotel to maintain its security, and also a notification will be sent automatically to the security authority at the same time.
The hotel also has the possibility to send a report of suspicion of one of the renters to the security authority, such as drug smuggling or others..
