## Description
It is a security application that aims to find wanted persons, obtain information to track them, and automatically send direct reports to the security authorities when they try to enter any hotel.
The application has 3 types of users:
Users: the security agency, hotels, citizens


The security authority: the application enables the security authority to receive reports of the presence of wanted persons in hotels, and these automatic reports help in tracking the wanted persons, and the security authority also receives reports of suspicion of one of the hotelâ€™s tenants such as drug smuggling and others ....

Hotels: The application helps to enhance the security of hotels. When a security-requested tenant comes or has a report, the hotel will show a security warning aimed at guarding against him and not entering the hotel to maintain its security, and also a notification will be sent automatically to the security authority at the same time.
The hotel also has the possibility to send a report of suspicion of one of the tenants to the security authority, such as drug smuggling or others..

Citizen: The application helps the citizen to communicate directly with the important security authorities such as the police, the Red Crescent, the civil defense, the fight against drugs.....etc.
It also displays the locations of the important security centers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
